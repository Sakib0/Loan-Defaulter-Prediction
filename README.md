# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting loan defaulters using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to individuals' financial and demographic information, and the goal is to classify whether a person is likely to default on a loan (Risk_Flag).
Features of the Project

      •	Data Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable (Risk_Flag).
      •	Visualization: Used seaborn and matplotlib for visualizing categorical and numerical data distributions.
      •	Feature Engineering: Processed and transformed raw data to make it suitable for machine learning models.
      •	Model Building: Trained and evaluated machine learning models to predict loan defaulters.
      •	Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
            Key Files
      •	Loan_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
      •	Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the model (not included in the repository for privacy reasons).
      •	Results: Visualizations and metrics summarizing the model's performance.

 


Future Work
      •	Improve model accuracy by experimenting with advanced algorithms.
      •	Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
      •	Add more robust feature selection and engineering techniques.
